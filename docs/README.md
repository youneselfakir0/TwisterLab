# TwisterLab Documentation

## Overview

TwisterLab is a cloud-native, multi-agent AI infrastructure designed to facilitate complex tasks through autonomous agents. Built on a robust architecture using Python and FastAPI, TwisterLab leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and a custom communication language called TwisterLang to enable seamless interaction between agents.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Agents**: TwisterLab consists of a swarm of AI agents that collaborate to perform various tasks such as monitoring, backups, and incident resolution.
- **Cloud-Native Architecture**: The system is designed for deployment on Kubernetes, emphasizing automation, monitoring, and CI/CD practices.
- **Structured Communication**: The TwisterLang protocol ensures standardized, compressed, and observable communications between agents, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
- **Flexible Operation Modes**: The system can operate in real, hybrid, or mock modes, showcasing its maturity in design for development and testing.
