"""
Minimal RealDesktopCommanderAgent for demo and tests.

This agent wraps the DesktopCommander features required by the API and
provides a simple execute contract to simulate command execution on a
remote machine. Keep this lightweight – it can be replaced later with a
full-featured implementation that actually executes commands securely.
