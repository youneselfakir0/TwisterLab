"""
Minimal RealResolverAgent implementation for the TwisterLab 'real' agent pack.

This file provides a small, test-friendly class that implements the
interface expected by the AgentRegistry. These are intentionally small and
simplified – they can be extended later with real logic (SOPs, tool calls,
and integrations).
